# covid — br
> this app was previously hosted at [`covid-br.com`](https://covid-br.com) but i lended the domain to a vaccination dashboard because it’s more useful now.

> all the information this dashboard shows is best presented elsewhere now, i did this when our government stopped disclosuring official data about covid cases/deaths.
